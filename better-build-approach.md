# Better Build Approach for Tap Dash Game

The error `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/expo/workingdir/build/android/gradlew'` means that the Android build files haven't been generated yet. 

## Understanding the Problem

When you work with Expo projects, there are two main approaches:

1. **Managed workflow** - where Expo handles all native code for you
2. **Development build** - where native code is generated and you can customize it

Your project appears to be using Expo SDK 52 but doesn't have the Android build files generated yet.

## Solution: Pre-eject the App

Before using EAS Build, you need to generate the native Android code:

```bash
# Generate the Android native code
npx expo prebuild --platform android

# Make gradlew executable
chmod +x android/gradlew

# Now you can run EAS build
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Alternative: Build Locally

You can also build the APK locally:

```bash
# Generate native code if you haven't already
npx expo prebuild --platform android

# Build a debug version
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug

# The APK will be in android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
```

## Alternative: Use Expo Application Services without native code

If you want to stay in the managed workflow:

```bash
# Configure your project to use EAS Build in managed workflow
npx eas-cli build:configure

# Create a new eas.json with this content:
# {
#   "build": {
#     "preview": {
#       "distribution": "internal",
#       "android": {
#         "buildType": "apk"
#       }
#     },
#     "production": {
#       "android": {
#         "buildType": "app-bundle"
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }

# Build using the managed workflow
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```

## Generate App Bundle (.aab) Locally

If you specifically need an AAB file for Google Play:

```bash
# Generate native code
npx expo prebuild --platform android

# Build the AAB
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease

# The AAB will be in android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
```

## Why This Happened

Expo projects can be in different states:
- Pure managed workflow (no native code)
- Prebuild/ejected (with native code)
- Custom dev builds

The error occurred because EAS was looking for native Android files that don't exist yet. Using `npx expo prebuild` creates these files.
